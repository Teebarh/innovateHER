### The Problem
Maternify addresses the issue of fragmented pregnancy information, aiming to provide expectant mothers with reliable and personalized resources for a healthier maternal journey. In alignment with the third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3), our mission is to contribute to global well-being by ensuring access to quality healthcare and promoting overall health during pregnancy and beyond.

### Our Solution
The Maternify project aims to create an intuitive and resourceful web application supporting expectant mothers. By integrating user-friendly design with reliable, comprehensive resources, the app seeks to enhance maternal and child well-being, addressing a need for healthcare accessibility and education.
